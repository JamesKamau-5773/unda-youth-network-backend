## ❓ FAQs & Troubleshooting

### Account & Login

A: Contact your supervisor or admin to reset your password. Self-service password reset is coming soon.

**Q: My account is locked. How do I unlock it?**  
A: Wait 30 minutes after your last failed login attempt, then try again. If still locked, contact your supervisor.

**Q: Can I change my email address?**  
A: Yes, update it in your profile or contact admin for assistance.

**Q: Why was my registration rejected?**  
A: Contact admin for specific reasons. Common causes: incomplete information, duplicate account, eligibility issues.

### Mental Health Features

**Q: Who can see my assessment results?**  
A: Only you, your assigned supervisor, and administrators. Results are confidential and never shared publicly.

**Q: How often should I take assessments?**  
A: At minimum: baseline (when joining), then quarterly. Your supervisor may request more frequent assessments if providing active support.

**Q: What if I score high on an assessment?**  
A: Your supervisor will be notified and will reach out to provide support. High scores indicate you may benefit from professional help, which we can connect you to.

**Q: I didn't receive today's affirmation. Why?**  
A: Check your spam folder if via email. For SMS, verify your phone number is correct in your profile. Contact admin if problem persists.

### Events

**Q: Can I bring a friend to an event?**  
A: Depends on the event. Check event details or ask organizers. Some events are UNDA members only; others welcome guests.

**Q: What if I registered but can't attend?**  
A: Cancel your registration as soon as possible to free up space for others.

**Q: Will I receive a certificate?**  
A: Certificates are issued for specific events (training, workshops). Check event details. You must attend fully to receive a certificate.

### Seed Funding

A: Yes, but wait for a decision on your first application before submitting another. You can reapply if rejected.

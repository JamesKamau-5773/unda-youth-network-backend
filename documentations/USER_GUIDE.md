# UNDA Youth Network Management System - User Guide

## What is UNDA Youth Network?

UNDA Youth Network is a **digital platform** designed to help youth organizations manage their programs, track participant progress, and ensure the safety of young people. Think of it as a **smart filing cabinet** that keeps all your youth program information organized, secure, and easily accessible from anywhere.

---

## Who Is This For?

- **Youth Workers & Supervisors**: Manage young people's information, track their progress, and monitor safeguarding concerns
- **Program Administrators**: Oversee the entire youth program, generate reports, and ensure compliance
- **Prevention Advocates (Young People)**: Access their own information and track their personal development journey

---

## How Does It Work?

### **Simple Login System**
Just like logging into your email or social media:
1. Visit the website
2. Enter your username and password
3. Access your personalized dashboard

**Security Feature**: Your account locks automatically after 5 failed login attempts to prevent unauthorized access - like a security lock on your front door.

### **Role-Based Access**
Everyone sees only what they need:
- **Prevention Advocates** see their own information only
- **Supervisors** see their assigned prevention advocates
- **Admins** see everything and manage the system

Think of it like a **hospital**: patients see their own records, nurses see their assigned patients, and hospital administrators oversee everything.

## Key Features That Make UNDA Stand Out

### 1. **Comprehensive Prevention Advocate Profiles**
Unlike basic databases that only store names and addresses, UNDA captures the **complete picture** of each young person:

#### **Personal Development Tracking**
- Education history (schools attended, qualifications)
- Skills and talents (sports, arts, leadership)
- Career interests and goals
- Achievements and milestones

**Why It Matters**: Helps supervisors provide **personalized support** and identify opportunities that match each young person's interests and abilities.

#### **Health & Wellbeing**
UNDA captures critical health information to ensure prevention advocate safety during programs and activities:

**Medical Information**:
- Medical conditions (asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.)
- Known allergies (food, medication, environmental)
- Disabilities or additional needs (physical, learning, developmental)
- Required medications and dosages
- Dietary requirements (religious, medical, or preference-based)

**Mental Health Support**:
- Current support services (counseling, therapy)
- Special considerations or accommodations needed
- Emergency contact procedures

**Why This Matters**: 
- **Safety**: Staff know about allergies before serving food or planning outdoor activities
- **Inclusion**: Accommodations can be arranged in advance (wheelchair access, sensory-friendly spaces)
- **Emergency Response**: Critical medical information accessible instantly if urgent care needed
- **Person-Centered Care**: Support tailored to individual health needs

**Example**: If a prevention advocate has severe peanut allergies, supervisors are alerted before any event involving food. The system flags this during meal planning to prevent potentially life-threatening exposure.

#### **Risk Assessment & Safeguarding**

UNDA includes a **risk categorization system** to prioritize support and ensure vulnerable young people receive appropriate attention:

**Risk Levels**:
- **Low Risk**: Stable situation, regular engagement, no immediate concerns
- **Medium Risk**: Some concerns requiring monitoring (attendance issues, family stressors, minor behavioral changes)
- **High Risk**: Serious concerns requiring immediate attention (safeguarding issues, mental health crisis, homelessness, abuse indicators)

**Risk Assessment Components**:
1. **Risk Level**: Current risk category (Low/Medium/High)
2. **Risk Notes**: Detailed assessment including:
	- Specific risk factors identified
	- Protective factors (supportive family, engaged in school)
	- Intervention plans and referral actions
	- Safeguarding concerns documented
3. **Last Contact Date**: When supervisor last had meaningful interaction with prevention advocate
4. **Next Review Date**: Scheduled date for reassessing risk level
5. **Assessment History**: Date/time of last risk assessment update

**Automated Alerts**:
The system automatically flags:
- **High-risk prevention advocates** who need immediate attention
- **Overdue reviews** where assessment date has passed

**Dashboard Alerts** (Admin View):
Admin dashboard displays urgent alerts prominently:
- High-risk prevention advocate count with detailed list
- Overdue review count with prevention advocate names and due dates
- Color-coded visual indicators (red for high-risk, orange for overdue)
- Quick links to prevention advocate profiles for immediate action

**Why This System Matters**:
- **Prevents Cases Falling Through Cracks**: No prevention advocate is forgotten; overdue reviews automatically surface
- **Prioritizes Resources**: High-risk cases get immediate supervisor attention
- **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Documented risk factors support referral decisions
- **Accountability**: Clear record of when and why risk levels changed
- **Compliance**: Meets safeguarding best practices and regulatory requirements

**Example Scenario**: A supervisor notices a prevention advocate has missed three consecutive sessions. They update the risk level from Low to Medium, set a next review date for 2 weeks, and document concerns in risk notes. The system automatically includes this prevention advocate in the "Requires Monitoring" filter, ensuring they receive additional check-ins.

#### **Advanced Filtering & Search**

Supervisors can quickly find prevention advocates using multiple filter criteria:

**Available Filters**:
- **Status**: Active, Inactive, On Hold
- **Risk Level**: Low, Medium, High
- **County**: Filter by geographic location
- **Institution**: Filter by school or organization

**How It Works**:
1. Navigate to Supervisor Dashboard
2. Use dropdown filters at top of page
3. Click "Apply Filters" to refine prevention advocate list
4. Active filters shown as color-coded badges
5. "Clear Filters" button resets to show all prevention advocates

**Filter Combinations**: 
Combine multiple filters for precise searches:
- "Show me all High-Risk prevention advocates in Nairobi County" → Status: Active + Risk: High + County: Nairobi
- "Find inactive prevention advocates needing follow-up" → Status: Inactive + Risk: Medium/High

**Prevention Advocate Count Updates**: 
The "Total Prevention Advocates" metric dynamically updates to show filtered count vs total count, giving supervisors clear visibility into how many prevention advocates match their criteria.

**Why This Matters**:
- **Efficiency**: Find specific prevention advocate groups in seconds instead of manual searching
- **Targeted Interventions**: Identify high-risk prevention advocates in specific locations for group interventions
- **Workload Management**: See how many prevention advocates match specific criteria for planning
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Quick insights into distribution of risk levels, statuses, locations

**Example**: A supervisor wants to organize a support group for prevention advocates with mental health needs in Kiambu County. They filter: Risk: Medium/High → County: Kiambu → Review health notes → Contact relevant prevention advocates directly.


- Medical conditions and allergies
- Dietary requirements
- Disability information
- Mental health support needs

**Why It Matters**: Ensures **safety during activities** and helps staff provide appropriate support. If a prevention advocate has a nut allergy, supervisors know to avoid certain foods at events.

#### **Family Support Network**
- Emergency contacts
- Parent/guardian information
- Social worker details (if applicable)
- Household situation

**Why It Matters**: Enables quick action in emergencies and helps understand each young person's **home support system**.

### 2. **Advanced Safeguarding System**

#### **Risk Assessment & Monitoring**
- Track safeguarding concerns and incidents
- Record risk levels (low, medium, high)
- Document support plans and interventions
- Monitor changes over time

**Real-World Example**: If a supervisor notices concerning behavior, they can log it immediately. The system tracks patterns over time and alerts administrators if risk levels increase.

#### **Automatic Alerts**
- High-risk cases flagged on dashboards
- Missing information highlighted
- Overdue reviews shown in red

**Why It Matters**: No young person falls through the cracks. The system acts like a **safety net**, ensuring vulnerable prevention advocates receive timely support.

---

### 3. **Smart Search & Filtering**

Find information instantly:
- Search by name, education, location, or status
- Filter by risk level, engagement, or support needs
- Sort by any field in alphabetical order

**Time-Saving Example**: Instead of flipping through hundreds of paper files to find all prevention advocates attending a specific school, supervisors can filter the list in **2 seconds**.

---

### 4. **Detailed Status Tracking**

Track every prevention advocate's journey:
- **Active**: Currently participating
- **Inactive**: Temporarily away
- **Graduated**: Successfully completed the program
- **Alumni**: Former participants maintaining contact
- **Transferred**: Moved to another program
- **Withdrawn**: Left the program

**Why It Matters**: Provides clear **program outcomes** and helps identify who needs re-engagement support.

---

### 5. **Interactive Dashboards**

#### **Supervisor Dashboard**
- See all assigned prevention advocates at a glance
- Color-coded risk indicators (red = high, orange = medium, green = low)
- Quick access to add or edit prevention advocate information
- Search and filter tools built-in

#### **Admin Dashboard**
- Overview of entire youth network
- Statistics (total prevention advocates, supervisors, high-risk cases)
- System-wide search capabilities
- User management tools

**Visual Design**: Clean, professional interface that looks like modern apps (Netflix, Instagram) rather than old-fashioned office software.

---

### 6. **Real-Time Data Updates**

Changes appear instantly across all devices:
- Supervisor updates a prevention advocate's status → Admin sees it immediately
- Prevention Advocate's information updated → Dashboard refreshes automatically

**Why It Matters**: No confusion from outdated information. Everyone works with the **same current data**, like Google Docs where multiple people can edit simultaneously.

---

### 7. **Mobile-Friendly Design**

Works perfectly on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Smartphones

**Practical Use**: Supervisors can update prevention advocate information during home visits using their phone, without waiting to return to the office.

## Security Features (What Keeps Data Safe)

### **1. Bank-Level Encryption**
- Passwords scrambled using military-grade technology (bcrypt)
- Impossible to read even if someone accessed the database
- Like locking valuables in a safe, not just a drawer

### **2. Account Lockout Protection**
- 5 failed login attempts = account locked for 30 minutes
- Prevents hackers from guessing passwords
- Automatic unlock after timeout or admin reset

### **3. Session Security**n
